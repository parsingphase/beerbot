## Beerbot: an enhanced view of your Untappd data

Beerbot is a tool to make better use of your [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) lists and checkin history.

To use it, you'll need to be able to use Untappd's export tools, which means you'll need a paid 
[Untappd Supporter Account](https://untappd.com/supporter).

You can use the tools in one of two ways - either download the code and run it yourself, or just forward your 
Untappd export emails to the service.

### Run at home
You'll need a little patience or some experience running Python code to do this. Everything is available and documented
at [{{ site.github.project_title }}]({{ site.github.repository_url }}#readme).

This is the slightly more powerful, but less convenient option.

### Forward by email
For maximum convenience you can just forward the export emails from Untappd to a robot address. 
At the moment, I'm not making this address globally available so that I can keep usage under control, 
so please email me at [richard@phase.org](mailto:richard@phase.org?subject=Beerbot Access Request) if you want to use 
this (doesn't matter if you don't know me, this is only about controlling numbers).

### Getting your data

The process for getting your data, whether for personal download or for email forwarding is described in 
"[Exporting your data](exporting.md)". 

### Making the best of Beerbot

Beerbot will make a best effort to process any export it's fed, but you can get a lot more out of it if you
[feed it the best data](feedingBeerbot.md).
