## Beerbot: an enhanced view of your Untappd data

Beerbot is a tool to make better use of your [Untappd](https://untappd.com/) lists and checkin history.

To use it, you'll need to be able to use Untappd's export tools, which means you'll need a paid 
[Untappd Supporter Account](https://untappd.com/supporter).

You can use the tools in one of two ways - either download the code and run it yourself, or just forward your 
Untappd export emails to the service.

### Run at home:
You'll need a little patience or some experience running Python code to do this. Everything is available and documented
at [{{ site.github.project_title }}]({{ site.github.repository_url }}#readme).

This is the slightly more powerful, but less convenient option.

### Forward by email:
For maximum convenience you can just forward the export emails from Untappd to a robot address. 
At the moment, I'm not making this address globally available so that I can keep usage under control, 
so please email me at [richard@phase.org](mailto:richard@phase.org?subject=Beerbot Access Request) if you want to use 
this (doesn't matter if you don't know me, this is only about controlling numbers).

Once you've got the address, read the instructions for [getting your export](exporting.md).
